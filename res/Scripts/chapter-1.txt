What’s that?
A faint murmur masquerades amongst the silence.
It’s you.
...
But wait--who *are*...?
You have no memories.
You just...exist.
You just...are.
You have no beginning nor ending.
No past nor future.
Just the present.
Just now.
...
You: Wh...what do we do now?
I’m afraid that’s not my decision.
It’s up to you.
[Chapter 2]
