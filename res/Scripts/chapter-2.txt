What *do* we do now?
	> !!! Ponder my existence. 
		...
		Just...think.
		...
		Why do you exist?
		What are you here for?
		Or...is there even a reason for your existence?
			> Of course.
				What is it?
					> To live a successful life.
						There *is* no life here.
						It’s just you.
						And you just...are.
						You: So, what do we do now?
						Who are you?
							> !!!
					> To ensure the happiness of others.
						There’s nobody here.
						Just you.
						!!!
					> !!! To devote myself to some other cause.
					> !!! To pave the way to the future.
						The future doesn’t exist.
						It’s never been anything but now.

			> Nope.
				Your existence is meaningless.
				...
				At least...not intrinsically.
				!!! mention opportunities

	> !!! Explore.
		There’s nothing here.
		Nowhere to go...
			> Let’s explore anyways.
				You find nothing.
				Because...that’s all there is.
				Does...anything exist?
					> Umm...yes?
						Do...you exist?
							> Yes?
								Of course you exist.
								You always have existed.
								You always will exist.
								[Chapter 2]
							> ...
								You never existed.
								You never have.	
								[Chapter -1]
					> I...I guess not...
						...
						Nothing exists.
						Nothing at all.
						[Chapter -1]
			> Nevermind.
				
	> !!! Rest.
		You doze off for eternity.
		And yet, you awake.
		...
		A familiar silence permeates the universe.
